The dynamics of microorganisms are in part the result of microscopic interactions between organisms and their
surrounding environment SOURCE NEEDED. Rather than model this directly, this is typically captured by introducing
stochastic terms to their dynamics. This is done in all the models covered in this report, and for that reason we will give an 
overview of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) followed by their solution via the Monte Carlo methods and the
Fokker-Planck equation.
