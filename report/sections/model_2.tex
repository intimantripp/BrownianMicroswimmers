The second modelinvestigated was proposed by Chen \textit{et al}. \cite{chen2021shape}, 
building on the work of Spagnolie \textit{et al}. 
\cite{spagnolie2015geometric}. This advances  on the previous model by incorporating hydrodynamic interactions
with the channel walls into the SDEs for the cell.

Spagnolie \textit{et al.} approximate the velocity field around an elliptic swimmer by first treating the system as a 
\textit{stresslet} - a force dipole - and then by Fax√©n's Law obtaining the corresponding velocity field for a 
swimmer with elliptic shape. Figure shows two illustrative charts of a microswimmer treated as a stresslet, and the 
velocity field around this elliptic stresslet near the boundary.
